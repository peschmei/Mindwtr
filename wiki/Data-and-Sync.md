# Data and Sync

Mindwtr stores data locally and supports multiple synchronization options between devices.

Mindwtr does **not** run a hosted cloud service. Sync is local‑first and user‑configured: you choose how the `data.json` file (and `attachments/`) moves between devices. It won’t happen automatically until you set up one of the options below—but once configured, it works smoothly.

Current desktop and mobile builds split settings into two pages:
- **Settings → Sync** for backend setup, sync options, history, and recovery snapshots
- **Settings → Data** for backup/restore/import, attachment cleanup, and diagnostics

This page is the user-facing setup and recovery guide. For maintainer-level merge rules and diagnostics fields, see [[Sync Algorithm]].

For desktop vault import and note deep links, see [[Obsidian Integration]].

## Data Storage

### Desktop

Data is stored in a local SQLite database, with a JSON sync/backup file:

| Platform    | Database (SQLite)                                  | JSON (sync/backup)                                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Linux**   | `~/.local/share/mindwtr/mindwtr.db`                 | `~/.local/share/mindwtr/data.json`                     |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%/mindwtr/mindwtr.db`                      | `%APPDATA%/mindwtr/data.json`                          |
| **macOS**   | `~/Library/Application Support/mindwtr/mindwtr.db`  | `~/Library/Application Support/mindwtr/data.json`      |

Config is stored separately:

| Platform    | Location                                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Linux**   | `~/.config/mindwtr/config.toml`               |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%/mindwtr/config.toml`               |
| **macOS**   | `~/Library/Application Support/mindwtr/config.toml` |

> Legacy Tauri builds used `~/.config/tech.dongdongbh.mindwtr/` and `~/.local/share/tech.dongdongbh.mindwtr/` on Linux. These are auto-migrated when detected.

### Mobile

Data is stored in a local SQLite database, with a JSON sync/backup file:

- **SQLite DB**: `mindwtr.db`
- **JSON backup**: `data.json`

---

## Sync Backends

Mindwtr directly supports five sync backends:

- **Native iCloud / CloudKit Sync**: Apple-only native sync for core data and attachment assets where available
- **File Sync**: a user-selected folder/file (`data.json` + `attachments/`)
- **Dropbox OAuth Sync**: direct Dropbox App Folder sync in supported builds
- **WebDAV**: any compatible WebDAV endpoint
- **Mindwtr Cloud (Self-Hosted)**: your own `apps/cloud` endpoint

In **Settings → Sync**, supported builds show these as one backend selector, then explain the selected setup path:

- **Cloud Sync**: **Dropbox** and **iCloud** on Apple platforms
- **Folder / File Sync**: **File**
- **Advanced / Custom Server**: **WebDAV** and **Self-Hosted**

Existing Dropbox setups continue to work; they are simply shown as the top-level **Dropbox** backend under the **Cloud Sync** explanation instead of being nested under a self-hosted/cloud-provider picker.

### Direct vs indirect provider support

- **Directly supported providers/protocols**: native iCloud / CloudKit on supported Apple builds, WebDAV servers, the Mindwtr self-hosted endpoint, and Dropbox OAuth (supported builds).
- **Indirectly supported providers**: iCloud Drive, Google Drive, OneDrive, Syncthing, network shares, and Dropbox via File Sync.
- **Important**: native iCloud sync is **Apple-only**. Android, Windows, and Linux should use File Sync, WebDAV, Mindwtr Cloud, or Dropbox instead.

**Quick guidance:**
- **Dropbox**: easiest cross-platform cloud option in supported builds; connect with OAuth and Mindwtr uses its Dropbox App Folder.
- **Syncthing**: device-to-device file sync. Best on the same LAN/subnet. For remote sync, use a Syncthing relay or a mesh VPN (Nebula/Tailscale).
- **WebDAV**: use a provider that supports WebDAV (e.g., Nextcloud, ownCloud, Fastmail, self-hosted).
- **iCloud**: use native iCloud sync on supported Apple builds, including attachment assets, or iCloud Drive via File Sync.
- **Google Drive/OneDrive**: use File Sync (and Android bridge apps when needed).

## Sync Recommendations

- **Easiest plug-and-play cloud sync:** Dropbox OAuth in supported builds.
- **Best Apple-only setup:** native iCloud / CloudKit on supported Apple builds.
- **Best BYOS remote sync:** WebDAV or Mindwtr Cloud (Self-Hosted). The app controls the sync cycle and merges per item.
- **File Sync (Syncthing/Dropbox/etc.):** works, but **conflicts are file-level** because `data.json` is a single file.
- **Best practices for File Sync:** avoid editing on two devices at the same time, and wait for sync to finish before opening the app on another device. If conflicts appear, keep the newest `data.json` and delete the `data.json.sync-conflict-*` copies.

### Desktop Proxy

On desktop, Mindwtr can use an optional HTTP(S) proxy for network requests such as WebDAV, Dropbox, self-hosted Cloud sync, and external calendar subscriptions.

Set it in **Settings → Advanced → Network → Proxy URL**. Use a full URL such as `http://proxy-host:port` or `https://proxy-host:port`. Leave it blank to use the default network behavior, including any supported `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.

The in-app field is intentionally minimal: it is a single proxy URL, not a full proxy manager. SOCKS, PAC files, and per-backend proxy rules are not configured there. The setting is not synced across devices.

## Conflict Recovery

Mindwtr normally resolves item conflicts automatically. If a task you deleted comes back after syncing, the most common cause is a concurrent edit on another device inside the delete-vs-live ambiguity window. When revision numbers tie and operation times are within 30 seconds, Mindwtr preserves the live edit so it does not silently discard work.

What to do:
1. Open **Settings → Sync** and check the latest sync status/history for conflicts.
2. If the returned task is still unwanted, delete it again after all devices have finished syncing.
3. If both devices still disagree, sync each device manually one at a time, then keep the version you want and delete/restore once more.
4. If you need to recover older data, use **Settings → Data** or **Settings → Sync → Recovery snapshots** before making more edits.

### 1. Native iCloud / CloudKit Sync (Apple-only)

Mindwtr includes a native **iCloud** backend on supported Apple builds.

- **Guide**: [[iCloud Sync]]
- **Best for**: Apple-only device setups where you want a simpler experience than managing a shared folder
- **Not for**: Android, Windows, or Linux devices in the same sync setup

This backend is available on iPhone, iPad, and macOS. If you prefer a folder-based setup on macOS, you can still use **iCloud Drive + File Sync** instead.

### 2. File Sync

Sync via a shared JSON file with any folder-based sync service:

- Dropbox
- Google Drive
- Syncthing
- OneDrive
- iCloud Drive
- Any network folder

#### iCloud Drive as File Sync (macOS + iOS)

iCloud Drive also works with Mindwtr through **File Sync** if you want to sync through a shared folder instead of the native CloudKit backend.

Recommended setup:
1. On macOS, create a folder like `iCloud Drive/Mindwtr`.
2. In Mindwtr desktop, set **Sync Backend = File** and pick that folder.
3. Export once to create `data.json` and `attachments/`.
4. Wait for iCloud Drive to finish uploading.
5. On iOS, in Mindwtr mobile **Settings → Sync → Select Folder**, choose the same iCloud Drive folder in Files.
   - If a provider is greyed out in the iOS folder picker, select any JSON file inside the target folder. Mindwtr will still use that folder for `data.json` and `attachments/`.

Important:
- Sync both `data.json` **and** `attachments/`. Attachments are part of sync data.
- Do not move only `data.json` without `attachments/`, or attachment metadata/files can drift.
- If iCloud Optimize Storage offloads files, let Files re-download before running a manual sync.

#### iOS file bookmarks for Google Drive, OneDrive, and other Files providers

On iOS, Google Drive, OneDrive, and similar providers can be used through **File Sync** when they expose a file in the Files picker. If folder selection is unavailable, pick an existing JSON file in the target folder; Mindwtr stores a security-scoped bookmark and uses it for later reads and writes.

This file-scoped provider mode syncs `data.json`. Attachment folders are not available through every Files provider bookmark, so use native iCloud/CloudKit, Dropbox, WebDAV, or self-hosted Cloud when attachments need to sync reliably. If iOS reports that bookmark access expired, re-select the sync file in **Settings → Sync**.

#### Syncthing Notes (Recommended Setup)

Syncthing works well with Mindwtr, but the initial setup order matters.
Devices must be able to reach each other: best on the same subnet/LAN, or via a relay/mesh VPN (e.g., Nebula or Tailscale) if you want remote syncing.

**Recommended flow:**
1. Create a single Syncthing folder (e.g., `Mindwtr/`) and let it fully sync.
2. On desktop, choose that folder in **Settings → Sync** with the **File** backend selected.
3. **Export Backup** to that folder to create `data.json` and `attachments/`.
4. Wait for Syncthing to finish syncing to your phone.
5. On mobile, select the same folder in **Settings → Sync**.

**Why you see `attachments (1)` / `attachments (2)`**
Syncthing creates duplicate folders when both devices create or modify the same folder at the same time. This often happens if both devices open Mindwtr before the initial sync completes.

**How to fix duplicates:**
1. Pick the “real” `attachments/` folder (usually the one with more files).
2. Move files from `attachments (1)`/`attachments (2)` into `attachments/`.
3. Delete the duplicate folders and let Syncthing converge.

**Important:** Don’t sync `~/.local/share/mindwtr` directly. Mobile storage is sandboxed. Use the file sync folder + `data.json` instead.
If you already synced the app data directory, switch to a dedicated sync folder and re-select it in Settings.

#### Google Drive on Android (File Sync) and Dropbox File-Sync Fallback

Google Drive does **not** provide WebDAV. If you want to use Google Drive with file sync on Android, you need a bridge app that keeps a local folder in sync (so Mindwtr can read/write `data.json` directly).

Dropbox users on Android can use native Dropbox sync in supported builds. If you prefer file sync, the same bridge-app approach also works for Dropbox.

Examples:
- **Dropsync** (Dropbox)
- **Autosync** (Google Drive)
- **FolderSync** (generic)

Then point Mindwtr to the local synced folder in **Settings → Sync**.

#### OneDrive on Android (Recommended Setup)

Android’s official OneDrive app does **not** keep a local folder in continuous two‑way sync.
To use OneDrive reliably with Mindwtr on Android, install a “bridge” app:

- **OneSync (Autosync for OneDrive)**
- **FolderSync**

Then:
1. Create a OneDrive folder for Mindwtr (on desktop).
2. Use the bridge app to sync that folder to a local folder on Android.
3. In Mindwtr, select that local folder in **Settings → Sync** (Mindwtr will use `data.json` inside).

### 3. WebDAV Sync

Sync directly to a WebDAV server:

- Nextcloud
- ownCloud
- Fastmail
- Any WebDAV-compatible server

Mindwtr now creates missing parent folders automatically before the first `PUT`, so you can point it at a new empty folder without manually pre-creating every level.

WebDAV uses HTTPS for public URLs. Plain HTTP is allowed only for recognized local/private targets such as `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x` through `172.31.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`, loopback/private IPv6 addresses, `*.local`, and `*.home.arpa`. Use HTTPS for custom DNS, VPN hostnames, Tailscale, ZeroTier, and any name that is not recognized as local/private.

### 4. Mindwtr Cloud (Self-Hosted)

For advanced users, Mindwtr includes a simple sync server (`apps/cloud`) that can be self-hosted.

- **Protocol**: Simple REST API (GET/PUT)
- **Auth**: Bearer token (mapped to a specific data file on the server)
- **Deployment**: Node.js/Bun
- **Docker setup**: [[Docker Deployment]]
- **Operations guide**: [[Cloud Deployment]]

Important client note:

- **HTTPS is required for public Mindwtr Cloud URLs.** Plain HTTP is allowed automatically for local/private targets such as `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x` through `172.31.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`, loopback/private IPv6 addresses, `*.local`, and `*.home.arpa`.
- If you are exposing Cloud outside a trusted LAN, put the server behind HTTPS with a reverse proxy such as `caddy`, `nginx`, or `traefik`.
- Use HTTPS for custom DNS, VPN hostnames, Tailscale, ZeroTier, and any name that is not recognized as local/private. The **Allow insecure connections (HTTP)** setting is a compatibility setting for trusted local/private endpoints; it is not a public HTTP override.

### 5. Dropbox OAuth Sync

Mindwtr also supports direct Dropbox sync in supported desktop/mobile builds.

- **Scope**: Dropbox App Folder (`/Apps/Mindwtr/`)
- **Synced data**: `data.json` and `attachments/*`
- **Auth**: OAuth 2.0 + PKCE
- **Setup**: choose **Dropbox** in **Settings → Sync**, connect your account, then run **Test connection**
- **Guide**: [[Dropbox Sync]]

## How Sync Works

### Auto-Sync

Mindwtr automatically syncs in the following situations:

- **On startup** — shortly after the app launches.
- **On data changes** — shortly after task/project changes, with a short debounce so rapid edits sync together.
- **On app focus** — when the desktop app regains focus, throttled to every 30 seconds; this still runs without local edits so remote changes can be pulled promptly.
- **On app blur/background** — when you switch away from the desktop app, but only if there are pending local changes to push.
- **Periodic desktop heartbeat** — every 15 minutes while Mindwtr is running.

If an automatic sync fails, Mindwtr pauses automatic retry attempts for about 60 seconds. Manual sync remains available during that cooldown.

### Settings Sync Options

Mindwtr can sync select preferences across devices. Configure in **Settings → Sync → Settings sync options**.

Available options include:
- **Appearance** (theme)
- **Language & date format**
- **GTD preferences** (default schedule time and Focus task limit)
- **External calendar URLs** (ICS subscriptions)
- **AI settings** (models/providers)
- **Saved Filters** (Focus filter presets)

> API keys and local model paths are never synced.
> Settings conflict resolution is group-based. If two devices edit different fields in the same settings group at nearly the same time, the newer group update can overwrite the older one.

### Merge Strategy

Mindwtr uses **revision-aware Last-Write-Wins (LWW)** per item:
- Each task, project, section, and area carries an `updatedAt` timestamp.
- When available, revision metadata (`rev` and `revBy`) is used before falling back to plain timestamps.
- Soft-deleted items (tombstones) are preserved so deletions propagate correctly across devices.

Delete-vs-live conflicts use the **last operation time**, not just the raw `updatedAt`:
- For deleted items, Mindwtr compares `deletedAt` against the live item's latest update.
- If the delete and live edit are more than 30 seconds apart, the newer operation wins.
- Inside that 30-second ambiguity window, a higher revision number still wins when available. Otherwise, Mindwtr preserves the live item instead of eagerly letting the tombstone win.
- Practical effect: if you delete a task on one device within about 30 seconds of editing it on another device, the edited live task may reappear after sync. Delete it again after the devices have synced if you meant to remove it.

Clock-skewed future timestamps more than 5 minutes ahead of the merge clock are clamped during merge safety checks so a bad device clock does not dominate forever. If both sides are clamped into the future, Mindwtr still preserves their relative ordering instead of treating them as a false tie.

Detailed merge tie-breaks, retry behavior, and conflict examples live in [[Sync Algorithm]]. This page keeps the storage and operational overview only.

### Conflict Visibility & Clock Skew

After each sync, Mindwtr stores sync stats in settings:

- **Conflicts**: total conflict count and a small sample of conflicting IDs
- **Clock skew**: max observed timestamp skew between devices
- **Timestamp fixes**: when `updatedAt < createdAt`, timestamps are corrected during merge

You can see these details in **Settings → Sync** (desktop and mobile). Large skew values usually indicate device clocks are out of sync.  
On mobile, sync history entries are collapsed by default; tap to expand.

### Attachment Sync & Cleanup

- Attachments are synced **after** metadata merges.
- Missing attachments remain as placeholders until downloaded.
- Orphaned attachments are cleaned up automatically (and can be triggered manually on desktop in **Settings → Data**).
- Remote attachment cleanup is local-reference aware, not global-reference counted. If two devices create or retain references to the same remote attachment before they have synced with each other, one device may not know about the other reference yet. Let devices sync before deleting shared attachments, and reattach the file if cleanup removes a remote copy another device still needs.

## Desktop Sync Setup

### File Sync

1. Open **Settings → Sync**
2. Set **Sync Backend** to **File**
3. Click **Change Location** and select a folder in your sync service
4. Click **Save**

Mindwtr will automatically sync on startup and when data changes.

### WebDAV Sync

1. Open **Settings → Sync**
2. Set **Sync Backend** to **WebDAV**
3. Enter your WebDAV server details:
   - **URL** — Folder URL; Mindwtr will store `data.json` inside (e.g., `https://nextcloud.example.com/remote.php/dav/files/user/Mindwtr`)
   - **Username** — Your WebDAV username
   - **Password** — Your WebDAV password
4. Click **Save WebDAV**

If the target folder path does not exist yet, Mindwtr will try to create the missing parent collections automatically before uploading `data.json`.

> **Linux note:** If your desktop session does not provide a Secret Service keyring (for example `org.freedesktop.secrets` is unavailable), Mindwtr falls back to local secrets storage in `~/.config/mindwtr/secrets.toml`.

> **Tip:** For Nextcloud, the URL format is:
> `https://your-server.com/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/path/to/folder`
>
> URLs with explicit ports are supported (e.g., `https://example.com:5000/mindwtr`).

## Mobile Sync Setup

Mobile sync requires manually selecting a sync folder due to Android/iOS storage restrictions.

On iOS, some cloud providers may not expose folder selection in Files. In that case, select any JSON file inside the target sync folder; Mindwtr will resolve and use the folder path for sync.

### 1. Export Your Data First

1. Go to **Settings → Data**
2. Tap **Export Backup**
3. Save the file to your sync folder (e.g., Google Drive)

### 2. Select Sync Folder

1. In **Settings → Sync**
2. Tap **Select Folder**
3. Navigate to your sync folder
4. Select the folder that contains (or will contain) `data.json`

### 3. Auto-Sync

Mobile now syncs automatically:
- When the app goes to background
- 5 seconds after data changes
- When returning to the app (if >30 seconds have passed)

You can also tap **Sync** manually anytime in Settings.

---

## SQLite + JSON Sync Bridge

Mindwtr uses SQLite as the primary local store. `data.json` is the sync and backup snapshot, not a second equal source of truth.

- **Cold start / normal reads**: the app reads local SQLite-backed storage.
- **Outgoing sync**: pending local saves are flushed first, then the current snapshot is exported to `data.json` / remote storage.
- **Incoming sync**: external JSON is validated, normalized, merged with local data, and persisted back into SQLite-backed storage.
- **Device-local sync diagnostics**: fields such as `lastSyncStats`, `lastSyncHistory`, and pending remote write recovery metadata stay local and are stripped from remote payloads.

Desktop and mobile do **not** freeze editing during sync. Instead, if local data changes while a sync write is in progress, the app aborts that cycle and queues a fresh one so the newer local snapshot is not overwritten.

See [ADR 0009](../docs/adr/0009-sqlite-json-sync-bridge.md) for the full contract.

## Sync Workflow

### Two Devices

**Initial setup:**
1. Set up desktop with sync folder
2. Export backup, save to sync folder
3. On mobile, select that folder

**Daily use:**
1. Make changes on Device A
2. Wait for sync service to replicate
3. On Device B, trigger sync (Settings → Sync)

### Multiple Devices

The same workflow applies. Avoid editing on multiple devices simultaneously to prevent conflicts.

---

## Troubleshooting Checklist

- **Confirm `data.json` exists** in your sync folder and is being updated.
- **Wait for Syncthing to fully sync** before opening Mindwtr on the second device.
- **Use “Sync” manually** in Settings if you want an immediate pull/push.
- **Check for duplicate attachment folders** (`attachments (1)`, etc.) and merge them.
- **Make sure device clocks are correct** (large skew causes conflicts).
- **Verify folder permissions** (Android SAF may block write access to some folders).

---

## Backup and Export

### Export Data

**Desktop:**
- Use **Settings → Data → Export Backup**
- Sync backends also keep `data.json` updated automatically when sync is enabled

**Mobile:**
1. Go to **Settings → Data**
2. Tap **Export Backup**
3. Save to your desired location

### Restore from Backup

Mindwtr can restore local data directly from a backup JSON file on both desktop and mobile.

Flow:
1. Open **Settings → Data**
2. Choose **Restore Backup**
3. Pick a Mindwtr backup JSON file
4. Review the backup summary and confirm

Before restore, Mindwtr validates the file and creates a recovery snapshot when the platform supports it. Restore is a full local replacement, not a merge.

- **Desktop**: a recovery snapshot is created in the app data snapshot folder before restore
- **Mobile**: a local recovery snapshot is created in app storage before restore
- **If the file is invalid**: restore is blocked and your current data stays untouched

See [[Backup and Restore]] for the detailed flow.

## Imports and Migrations

Use these guides when bringing task data from another app into Mindwtr. Imports add data to Mindwtr; they do not configure sync.

### TickTick CSV / ZIP Import

Mindwtr can import TickTick backups from **Settings → Data → Import from TickTick**.

- Supports TickTick **CSV** backups and **ZIP** backups containing the CSV export
- Creates Mindwtr areas from TickTick folders
- Creates Mindwtr projects from TickTick lists
- Preserves supported task status, dates, priorities, tags, notes, and recurrence
- Converts supported checklist/subtask data into Mindwtr checklist items

See [[TickTick Import]] for details and supported mappings.

### Todoist CSV / ZIP Import

Mindwtr can import Todoist exports from **Settings → Data → Import from Todoist**.

- Supports a single Todoist CSV export or a ZIP backup containing multiple project CSVs
- Creates Mindwtr projects from Todoist projects
- Preserves Todoist sections as Mindwtr sections
- Converts Todoist subtasks into checklist items
- Leaves imported tasks in **Inbox** so you can process them through your normal GTD flow

Recurring Todoist schedules are not recreated automatically. Mindwtr imports the task once and keeps the original recurrence text in the description.

See [[Todoist Import]] for details and supported mappings.

### DGT GTD JSON / ZIP Import

Mindwtr can import DGT GTD exports from **Settings → Data → Import from DGT GTD**.

- Supports a DGT GTD JSON export or a ZIP archive containing the exported JSON file
- Creates Mindwtr areas from DGT folders
- Creates Mindwtr projects from DGT projects
- Preserves DGT checklists as Mindwtr checklist tasks
- Preserves DGT contexts and tags on imported tasks
- Keeps supported repeat rules and warns when a DGT repeat pattern must be imported once with the original text preserved

Standalone DGT tasks stay in Mindwtr without forcing them into new projects, so you can organize them afterward if needed.

See [[DGT GTD Import]] for details and supported mappings.

### OmniFocus CSV / JSON / ZIP Import

Mindwtr can import OmniFocus exports from **Settings → Data → Import from OmniFocus**.

- Supports OmniFocus **CSV** exports, including UTF-8 and UTF-16 CSV files
- Supports Omni Automation / Shortcuts **JSON** exports and **ZIP** archives
- Creates Mindwtr areas from OmniFocus folders when metadata is available
- Creates Mindwtr projects from OmniFocus projects or referenced project names
- Keeps standalone OmniFocus actions outside projects so you can organize them later
- Preserves supported OmniFocus notes, tags, defer dates, due dates, completion state, and recurrence from the JSON path
- Converts simple nested tasks into checklist items when possible and flattens deeper hierarchy with the original path preserved

If recurrence or hierarchy fidelity matters, prefer the Omni Automation JSON / ZIP path over CSV. Planned dates and duration text are preserved in the imported description when Mindwtr does not have a direct field for them.

See [[OmniFocus Import]] for details and supported mappings.

### Apple Reminders Import (iOS)

On iPhone and iPad, Mindwtr can import incomplete Apple Reminders from **Settings → Data → Import from Apple Reminders**.

- Choose the Apple Reminders list to use as the capture source
- Adds new incomplete reminders to Mindwtr **Inbox**
- Preserves reminder titles and notes as task titles and descriptions
- Skips completed, titleless, and already imported reminders
- Can optionally delete imported reminders from Apple Reminders after Mindwtr adds them to Inbox

Apple Reminders import is a one-way import path, not a sync backend.

### Backup Strategy

- Regular exports to sync folder
- Keep local config folder backed up
- The sync file serves as a backup
- Recovery snapshots are saved automatically before restore/import operations

---

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Not Working

1. **Check sync folder path**
   - Ensure the path exists and is accessible
   - Verify permissions

2. **Check sync service**
   - Is Dropbox/Google Drive running?
   - Is the file synced across devices?

3. **Temporary file errors**
   - If a sync service is mid‑write (e.g., Syncthing), the JSON can be temporarily invalid.
   - Wait a moment and sync again.

4. **Manual sync**
   - Click Sync Now (desktop) or Sync (mobile)
   - Check for any error messages

### Data Conflicts

If you see unexpected data:
1. Export a backup of current data
2. Check the sync folder for the latest file
3. Manually review and merge if needed

### Mobile Sync File Not Found

1. Ensure the file exists in your cloud folder
2. Re-select the file in Settings → Sync
3. Check file permissions

### Reset Sync

To start fresh:
1. Delete the sync folder contents
2. Export from one device
3. Import/sync on other devices
