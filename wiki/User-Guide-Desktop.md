# User Guide: Desktop

The Mindwtr desktop app is built with [Tauri v2](https://tauri.app/), providing a lightweight, fast experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Overview

The desktop app features a sidebar navigation with all GTD views and a main content area.

---

## Interaction Patterns

- **Single click** toggles task details.
- **Double click** opens full edit mode.
- **Right click** opens context menus (projects, tasks).
- **Keyboard first**: global shortcuts and Vim/Emacs modes are optimized for desktop workflows.

## Focus Mode

Use Focus Mode to hide the sidebar and keep the list centered (800px max width).

- Toggle with **Ctrl+\\** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+\\** (macOS)
- Great for deep work or reviews

### System Tray

Mindwtr runs in the background to handle auto-sync.

- **Closing the window** minimizes the app to the system tray instead of quitting.
- **Click the tray icon** to show/hide the window.
- **Right-click the tray icon** to Quit the application completely.

## Views

### 📥 Inbox

Your capture zone. All new tasks land here before processing.

- **Add tasks** using the input field at the bottom
- **Quick-add syntax** is supported (see [[Getting Started]])
- **Process Inbox** using the clarify workflow

### 🎯 Focus

Your unified dashboard for daily engagement. Focus is not a full inventory of every task with status `next`; it narrows the list to work that is available now.

- **Today's Focus** — Starred priority tasks for deep work, up to your configured Focus limit.
- **Overdue** — Past due items.
- **Due Today** — Tasks due today.
- **Next Actions** — Ready tasks without due dates, filtered by context.
- **Review Due** — Items with tickler dates.

Focus hides future-start tasks and later tasks in sequential projects. Use **Contexts**, **Projects**, or **Search** when you need to inspect broader task inventory.

**Default Next Actions order:** Focus puts due-soon actions first, undated actions next, and far-future due actions last. Within the same bucket it uses priority when enabled, then start time, creation date, title, and id. See [[GTD Workflow in Mindwtr#How Focus sorts available actions]] for the full logic.

**Features:**
- **Context Filters**: Filter Next Actions by context (e.g., @home, @work) or tag. The filter picker groups contexts and tags so long metadata lists stay scannable.
- **Group by Context**: Use the list grouping control to group Next Actions by primary context, with context-less tasks collected under **No context**.
- **Saved Filters**: Save reusable Focus criteria such as projects, contexts, tags, priority, energy level, and time estimates.
- **Zen Mode**: Toggle to hide everything except Today's Focus tasks.
- **Pomodoro (Optional)**: Enable in **Settings → GTD → Features → Pomodoro timer** to show a focus/break timer panel (15/3, 25/5, 50/10, plus one optional custom preset). Leave it as **Timer only**, or turn on **Link timer to task** to show the Timer task picker and **Mark task done** action.

### 📁 Projects

Multi-step outcomes containing related tasks.

- **Sequential mode** — Only the first available project task appears in Focus
- **Parallel mode** — All available project tasks can appear in Focus
- **Sequential scope** — Sequential projects can advance project-wide or section-by-section; section scope shows the first available task in each section.
- **Status** — Active, Waiting, Someday, Archived
- **Areas of Focus** — Group projects by higher-level areas (e.g., Work, Health) to keep your sidebar organized.
- **Project tags** — Tag projects and filter by tag
- **Support notes** — Add planning notes and reference material
- **Sections** — Optional task groupings inside a project (phases, milestones, sub-workstreams). Sections are headings inside one project, not subtasks or separate projects.
- **Review date** — Set tickler dates for project review
- **Complete/Archive** — Mark projects as done or archive them

The **Project Section** field in the task editor assigns a task to one of the sections in its current project. It only has a useful value after the task belongs to a project that has sections.

### 🏷️ Contexts

Filter tasks by location or tool context:

- `@home`, `@work`, `@errands`, `@agendas`
- `@computer`, `@phone`, `@anywhere`

### 🏷️ Tags

Filter tasks by energy level, mode, or topic:

- Energy: `#focused`, `#lowenergy`, `#creative`
- Topic: `#health`, `#finance`

### ⏳ Waiting For

Track delegated items or tasks waiting on external events.

### 💭 Someday/Maybe

Incubate ideas you might want to pursue later.

### 🗓️ Calendar

Time-based view of tasks with due dates or start times.

### 📋 Board View

Kanban-style drag-and-drop board with columns:

- **Inbox** — Unprocessed items
- **Next Actions** — Ready to work on
- **Waiting For** — Delegated items
- **Someday/Maybe** — Deferred items
- **Done** — Completed tasks

### ✅ Done

Recently completed tasks. Use this as your short-term completion log for daily or weekly review.

### 📦 Archived

Completed tasks that have been filed away. Archived tasks are hidden from normal task lists, but you can search, restore, or permanently delete them here.

### 📝 Weekly Review

Guided GTD review wizard with steps:

1. Process Inbox
2. Review Calendar
3. Follow up Waiting For
4. Review Projects
5. Review Someday/Maybe

See [[Weekly Review]] for detailed guidance.

## AI Assistant (Optional)

Enable in **Settings → AI assistant**:

- **Clarify** — turn vague tasks into concrete next actions
- **Break down** — generate checklist steps for big tasks
- **Review analysis** — highlight stale tasks during review
- **Copilot** — context/tag/time suggestions while typing

AI is optional and only runs when you request it.

---

## Reusable Lists

Use checklists as templates:

- **Duplicate task** — copy a master list (packing, travel prep)
- **Reset checklist** — uncheck everything for reuse (groceries)

---

## Task Editor (View + Edit)

- Click a task to open a **read-only view** of all details.
- Press **Edit** (or `e`) to switch to edit mode.
- The editor starts minimal. Use **More options** to reveal advanced fields.
- **Project Section** is an organizational field for tasks inside a sectioned project. Leave it blank for Inbox tasks, unassigned tasks, or projects without sections.
- Status, Priority, and Energy Level use pill controls instead of dropdowns for faster keyboard and pointer selection.
- Date fields include quick chips for **Today**, **Tomorrow**, **+3 days**, **Next week**, **Next month**, and **No date**.
- In **Settings → GTD → Task Editor Layout**, choose whether the desktop editor opens as the inline side peek or a centered pop-up.

---

## Calendar Integration

Mindwtr can overlay external calendars in the Calendar view. On macOS it can read Apple Calendar through EventKit; on all desktop platforms it can read direct ICS subscription URLs.
Add an **ICS URL** in **Settings → Calendar** when you need an ICS subscription.
External events are read-only, but you can create a separate Mindwtr task from an event in Calendar; Mindwtr copies the event title, date/time, location, description, and calendar name where available.
On macOS, **Push tasks to calendar** can also write scheduled/due Mindwtr tasks into a selected writable Apple Calendar target. See [[Calendar Integration]] for setup details.

## Quick Capture

### Global Hotkey

Capture tasks from anywhere on your desktop without switching windows:

1. Press the global hotkey (`Ctrl+Alt+M`)
2. Type your task with quick-add syntax
3. Press Enter to add to Inbox
4. Continue what you were doing

You can change or disable this shortcut in **Settings → General → Input → Global quick add shortcut**.
Available options follow platform conventions:
- macOS: `Ctrl+Option+M` (default), `Ctrl+Option+N`, `Ctrl+Option+Q`, or legacy `Cmd+Shift+A`
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Alt+M` (default), `Ctrl+Alt+N`, `Ctrl+Alt+Q`, or legacy `Ctrl+Shift+A`
- Disabled (no system-wide Quick Add shortcut)

**Flatpak/Wayland note:** Some compositors do not allow app-registered global shortcuts. In that case, bind your desktop shortcut to `flatpak run tech.dongdongbh.mindwtr --quick-add` instead.

### Tray Icon

Click the system tray icon for instant capture:

- Quick-add input appears
- Use natural language syntax
- Task goes directly to Inbox

### Quick-Add Syntax

Mindwtr parses natural language when adding tasks:

**Attachments:** The **Add link** field accepts both URLs and local file paths (e.g., `/home/user/doc.pdf`, `C:\Users\you\file.txt`, or `file://...`).
See [[Attachments]] for sync, cleanup, and audio notes.

### Recurring Tasks

When you complete a recurring task, Mindwtr automatically creates the next instance with updated dates.

- **Strict** (default): keeps a fixed schedule cadence.
  Example: every 5 days remains anchored to the planned cycle.
- **Repeat after completion**: shifts the next due date from completion time.
  Example: complete now, next is due 5 days later.
- **Ends: Never / On date / After N occurrences**: choose whether the series runs forever, stops on a specific date, or stops after a fixed number of occurrences.
  `After N occurrences` counts the current task as part of the series total.

Mindwtr keeps one active instance of a recurring task. The Calendar shows that current instance when it has a due date or start time; future occurrences are not pre-filled until the current one is completed unless **Show next occurrence in Calendar** is enabled for a planning-only preview.

You can toggle this in the task editor recurrence field using **Repeat after completion**.
Use the same recurrence sheet to set an end date or an occurrence count when you need the series to stop automatically.
